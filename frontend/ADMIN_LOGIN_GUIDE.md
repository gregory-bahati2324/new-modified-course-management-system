# Admin Login Guide

## Accessing the Admin Dashboard

### Step 1: Navigate to Admin Login Page
Go to the admin login page by visiting:
```
/admin/login
```

Or simply click the admin portal link if available on the application.

### Step 2: Enter Admin Credentials
Use your administrator credentials to log in:
- **Email**: Your admin email (e.g., admin@must.ac.tz)
- **Password**: Your secure admin password

### Step 3: Access Dashboard
After successful authentication, you will be automatically redirected to the Admin Dashboard at `/admin/dashboard`

## Demo Credentials (Development Only)
For testing purposes, you can use these demo credentials:
- **Email**: `admin@must.ac.tz`
- **Password**: `admin123`

⚠️ **Important**: These demo credentials should be removed in production!

## Admin Dashboard Features
Once logged in, you have access to:

- **Pending Approvals**: Review and approve course submissions, instructor applications, etc.
- **Analytics**: View system-wide analytics and reports

## Security Notes
- Admin login page is separate from student/instructor login for enhanced security
- All admin access attempts are logged
- Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication when available
- Never share admin credentials

## Troubleshooting
